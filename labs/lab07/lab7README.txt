Armed with this knowledge, make lists of the advantages and disadvantages of trees and
hash tables (at least these implementations).

Trees:
    Advantages:
    -More consistent search time
    -Efficient
    
    Disadvantages:
    -Slower than hash tables

Hash Tables:
    Advantages:
    -Faster insert time and search time
    
    Disadvantages:
    -Less consistent search time


What else might you like to be able to measure to compare the
two data structures?

I would like to be able to measure the amount of memory that is used up for each
method.
